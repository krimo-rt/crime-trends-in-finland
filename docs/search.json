    "text": "The Finnish criminal justice system uses three age categories of youth, with repercussions on how offenders are punished or treated. Persons under 15 years of age are not criminally culpable. In such cases, the social services deal with the matter. However, the crime is entered to the police information system (and therefore to the SOCM). Age categories 15 to 17 and 18 to 20 have special stipulations reducing penal severity. To match this logic, we used the same age categories in crime trend description.\nDuring the last 10 years, theft offences by young people have decreased. Property destruction decreased in the first half of the decade in the 15 to 20 age groups, remaining stable after that. This crime type was stable in the youngest age group. Violence (assault offences) increased in the youngest group and decreased in the category 18 to 20. The middle category 15 to 17 showed a nonlinear trend: first a decrease, and after 2018, a moderate increase in police-recorded assaults. The increase in the group of less than 15 year-olds was stable and relatively drastic: the number of offences per 10 000 population increased from 11 in 2012 to 25 in 2021.\nThe Finnish Self-Report Delinquency Study is a nationally representative crime survey among 15–16 year-olds (Kaakinen and Näsi (2021)). Following the logic of this report, it is of some interest to compare the FSRD survey-based findings with the police-recorded crime trends in the age category 15 to 17. These comparisons are shown in Figure 5. Note that the police-recorded offending figure is offence-based while the survey observations are person-based. Also, the vertical scales differ it is a percentage for the survey and rate per 1,000 persons for the administrative statistic. Overall, the two sources largely agree on the direction of change in the three offence categories examined: a clear decrease in the first part of the observation decade was followed by a more stable phase. The administrative crime statistics and the self-reports-based survey source thus cross-validate one another in the domain of youth crime.\nBased on police recorded offences, the crime trends have been quite similar in the 18 to 20 and 15 to 17 age groups (decrease and levelling out). In the younger group, the trends are different and show increase of recorded violence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 Theft offences by young persons: comparison of police recorded offences (15–17-year-olds) (SOCM) and self-reported prevalence rates (15–16-year-olds).

    "text": "In this report, we have drawn on administrative crime statistics and KRIMO crime surveys to describe trends in selected crimes in Finland. The use of administrative statistics and survey data in tandem is mutually complementary. Administrative statistics do not include crimes which are not reported to the authorities. The propensity of people to report offences to the police is a temporal and spatial variable. To tackle this challenge, criminology has developed the hidden crime survey (Kivivuori 2011). On the other hand, such crime surveys typically fail to capture the most serious crimes, and the most marginalised offender and victim groups. Therefore, this summary report has focussed primarily (but not exclusively) on homicide and on crime types for which survey information is available, in order to present a cross-validated overview of recent crime trends.\nRegarding administrative statistics, the primary source is the Statistics on Offences and Coercive Measures (SOCM) compiled and published by Statistics Finland. In this report, we primarily used figures on offences reported to the police. Figures based on suspects in cleared offences are also needed whenever socio-demographic breakdown is needed. In both cases, counts are based on offences as observation units, meaning that a single person may have committed more than one offence per annum. The gross number of offences reported to the police may reflect crime incidence and/or reporting propensity. With the exception of homicide, attempts are included in the figures. Homicides are additionally examined by cause of death statistics, counting victims of lethal violence.\nRegarding crime surveys, we drew on KRIMO key monitoring systems, such as the Finnish Crime Victim Survey (FCVS) and the Finnish Self-Report Delinquency Study (FSRD). Finnish Crimes against Businesses Survey (FCBS), conducted in 2010 and 2018, has also been referenced to. KRIMO developed these survey systems by combining international models with methodological research in local conditions (Aaltonen et al. 2012); (Kivivuori, Sirén, and Danielsson 2012); (Kivivuori, Salmi, and Walser 2013); (Kivivuori et al. 2014); (Kaakinen and Näsi 2021).\nWe have cited selected further research if it provided clarification of observed trends and pattern changes, to allow the interested reader to find more in-depth analyses of the descriptive trends.\n\n\n\n\nAaltonen, M., J.

    "text": "2.1 Homicide\nHomicide includes five legal crime labels: murder, manslaughter, manslaughter under mitigating circumstances, infanticide, and causing of death in the context of an assault offence. In Finnish penal law, the last mentioned category refers to incidents in which the violence was intentional, while the result of death was not. Together, these crime rubrics correspond to the definition of homicide used in the European Homicide Monitor standard (Granath 2012), capturing lethal and intentional interpersonal violence.\nIn the last ten years, the number of these offences has varied between 116 and 74. In 2022, the homicide rate in Finland was 1.49 per 100 000 population.\nTable 1 Homicide offences reported to the police, Finland 2013–2022 (SOCM.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n\n\n\n\nHomicides\n107\n112\n116\n96\n74\n95\n83\n95\n94\n83\n\n\nHomicide per 100,000 pop\n1.96\n2.05\n2.11\n1.74\n1.34\n1.72\n1.50\n1.72\n1.69\n1.49\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the homicide trend based on cause-of-death statistics from 1955, using 5-year periods, with the year 2020 also given. The trend shows a high homicide rate period from 1970 to the beginning of the 1990s, after which a consistent homicide drop took place. The most recent observation year suggests an end to the drop among male victims. Note that infanticide, defined as including victims less than one year old, has not been included in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 Homicide fatality rate pare 100 000 population, Finland 1955-2020. Victims younger than 1 year old have not been included.\nFinnish homicide is still characterised by a high proportion of incidents involving drunken marginalised males. However, the presence of alcohol drunkenness in homicide has decreased since the 1990s (Lehti 2014) . During the last 10 years, the proportion of offenders under the influence of alcohol has remained rather stable whereas the role of drug use has increased. Finnish homicide trends have been extensively analysed from long duration change (Lehti and Sirén 2020) to analyses of the 1970s homicide boom (Kivivuori 2003) and the post-1990s homicide drop in Finland (Lehti 2014) and in the European context (Suonpää et al. 2022) ."

The number of reported offences has been stable since 2014, with approximately 6 offences per 1000 population. Numbers and rates were slightly higher in the first two years of the series (Table 2).\nTable 2 Assault offences reported to the police, Finland 2012-2021 (SOCM.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n\n\n\n\nAssault offences\n38,231\n35,515\n32,928\n33,661\n33,769\n33,535\n33,639\n33,849\n33,285\n34,123\n\n\nAssaults per 100,000 pop\n7.05\n6.51\n6.02\n6.13\n6.14\n6.08\n6.10\n6.13\n6.01\n6.15\n\n\n\nNational victim surveys largely corroborate this stable trend.

(FCVS).\nThe year 2020 shows a violence dip (Figure 2). The temporary decrease could probably be explained by COVID-19 related lockdowns and closures, as bars and restaurants were closed for a period in the spring of 2020. The most recent reading (2021) saw restoration of the standard level of risk. This temporary drop is not seen in police statistics. During the period 1980-2009, when intermittent victim surveys were conducted, Finnish victimisation trends and trends of recorded offences were often divergent, a discrepancy explained by an increasing propensity of victims to report crimes to the police. During the last decade, reporting propensity has saturated to a stable level, a partial explanation why survey and register sources yielded similar trends in assault offences."

In 2021 the number increased by more than a quarter (28%) from the previous year.

In the last few years, the number has been growing and in 2021, 2089 cases of child sexual abuse were reported to the police. Some of the increase can be explained by changes in law and reporting propensities but the increase in recent years cannot fully be explained by these changes.\nTable 4 Rape offences reported to the police, Finland 2012-2021 (SOCM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n\n\n\n\nChild sexual abuse offences\n1,542\n1,634\n1,389\n1,217\n1,218\n1,168\n1,373\n1,709\n1,770\n2,089\n\n\nChild sexual abuse offences per 10,000 p\n2.84\n3\n2.54\n2.22\n2.21\n2.12\n2.49\n3.09\n3.2\n3.77\n\n\n\nThe Finnish child victim survey (conducted in the years 1988, 2008 and 2013) and School Health Promotion Study (comparable question in 2019) asked ninth graders (age approx. 15) about their sexual experiences with persons at least 5 years older than them.

The number of thefts reported to the police has remained relatively stable in absolute terms and per population.

Within the general theft category, aggravated theft decreased from 3,248 in 2012 to 2,147 in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n\n\n\n\nReported theft offences\n138,750\n141,395\n143,141\n138,571\n131,432\n125,431\n122741\n126,906\n139,121\n127,791\n\n\nReported theft offences per 1,000 pop\n25.6\n25.9\n26.2\n25.3\n23.9\n22.8\n22.2\n23\n25.1\n23\n\n\n\nThe Finnish Crime Victim Survey captures the percentage of persons whose personal property was stolen outside the home (Figure 5).

Identity theft and consumer fraud have increased during the last decade, as observed in both administrative statistics and the FCVS survey system (Figure 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that theft offences reported to the police include crimes against businesses and institutions, a quantitatively major crime target. According to the Finnish Crimes against Businesses Survey, theft victimisation against the retail sector remained stable between 2010 and 2018, with some increase in offences committed by unknown persons (Saarikkomäki, Lehti, and Kivivuori 2019) . Based on this, it seems that the decreasing trend in theft has benefitted private persons and households more than the businesses in the retail sector."

The number of police-recorded economic crimes has decreased considerably from 2019, which marked the highest total numbers of economic crimes in ten years. In 2021, police registered 2,440 tax offences, accounting offences and bankruptcy offences.

The decrease from the peak of 2019 has mostly been due to the decrease of tax offences, just as the increase in 2010–2019 was due to the rising numbers of tax offences. Accounting of-fences and bankruptcy offences have remained fairly stable. The observed decrease in tax offences has likely been caused by the changing emphasis in resource allocation within the field of investigation of economic offences and risk-based tax audits.\nAs regards economic crime, no survey-based data are available to complement the above trend descriptions based on police statistics. In the 2018 Crimes against Businesses Survey (FCBS), the firms were asked to report if their competitors had used illegal means in business activities in relation to employees, such as illegal working conditions and terms. In the hotel and restaurant sector, eight per cent of the firms had perceived such illegal competition, whereas the same percentage in retail sector was 2 per cent (Saarikkomäki, Lehti, and Kivivuori 2019). However, the trend remains unspecified as there has not been repeated survey after 2018.\n\n\n\n\nFagerlund, M., M. Peltola, J. Kääriäinen, N. Ellonen, and H.

The dynamics of homicide has been connected to total alcohol consumption in the long historical perspective (Lehti and Sirén 2020) . However, while alcohol retains its high prevalence in crimes of violence, its role is decreasing. Both SOCM and youth crime surveys [Näsi (2016)] indicate that the proportion of offences committed while drunk has been decreasing during the recent decades. In homicide, the prevalence of alcohol has decreased considerably since the 1990s [Lehti (2014)] . Simultaneously with the decreasing role of alcohol, the share of homicides investigated as murders (instead of manslaughter or other penal codes for homicide) increased. During the last decade, the proportion of alcohol-related offenders has been stable. Most Finnish homicides are still related to alcohol and are investigated as manslaughter. Alcohol has been replaced in part by drugs and psychoactive substances as incident-level correlates of crime.\n\n\n\n\nLehti, M. 2014. “Homicide Drop in Finland, 19962012.” Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention 15 (2): 182199,. https://doi.org/10.1080/14043858.2014.963931.\n\n\nLehti, M., and R.

Comparison with the other Nordic countries is particularly relevant due to social and cultural similarities, and it shows Finland having the highest rate of homicide in the Nordic area (Lehti 2019). In the Finnish homicide report of 2019, 73 per cent of the countries representing the European Economic Area had lower homicide mortality rates than Finland (Lehti and Sirén 2020). The countries above the Finnish mortality were mostly from Eastern Europe.\nA recent study comparing the 1990s homicide drop in Finland with six other European countries found that the substantial drop was observed in all countries, and in both male and female victimisation (Suonpää et al. 2022) . In Finland, the relative distribution of homicide types remained stable: the most common homicide type was alcohol-related conflict out-side the criminal milieu for men, and family-related homicide for women, whereas homicides taking place in the criminal milieu remained exceptionally rare. The difference was stark with Switzerland, where the typical homicide victim is a woman killed by a family member, and with Sweden, where criminal milieu homicides of young males started to increase in the 2010s."

Due to specific sampling difficulties, the results of the last survey, the so-called EU-ICVS conducted in 2003-5, are not reliable for Finland (Aromaa and Heiskanen 2006). The four sweeps from 1988 to 1999, with a core group of seven to 12 European countries participating can be briefly summarised. These surveys suggest that the prevalence of assault or threats was higher than average in Finland. The proportion of countries manifesting lower violence prevalence ranged from 60 to 86 per cent in the four survey waves 1988-1999 (Dijk et al. 2007). Personal theft victimisation yields a different picture. With the exception of the first survey wave in 1988, only few (9-23 per cent) of the participating countries manifested lower theft victimisation percentages than Finland in the 1991-1999 survey waves. Thus, the ICVS appeared to indicate that during the 1990s, Finland was comparatively high on violence and comparative-ly low on theft.\nFor theft, we lack more recent international adult victim surveys. In contrast, for violence, some surveys have been conducted. Recent Crime, Safety and Victims’ Rights survey conducted by the European Fundamental Rights Agency shoes physical violence victimisation rates in 29 European countries. The comparison placed Finland as the second most violent European nation (F. R. A. 2021) after Estonia. Thus, in that survey on physical violence, the proportion of countries ranking lower than Finland was 96 per cent. For Finland, the ICVS sweeps 1988-1999 and the FRA survey of 2021 both indicated a violence problem at a higher level than is typical in Europe, a finding consistent with homicide rates. An earlier FRA survey of violence against women also showed high prevalence rates in Finland and the other Nordic countries (F. R. A. 2014). Methodological differences in national data collection could have influenced the findings in that survey (Holmberg 2022). Alternative or supplementary hypotheses include: high levels of equality place women more at risk of violence; and/or high levels of education expands the perception of conflicts to be considered as violence, and hence reporting of incidents in surveys will also be higher.\nThe Finnish Crimes Against Businesses survey of 2018 suggested that the Finnish retail sector suffers from a higher risk of shoplifting and violence against employees than their Dutch and UK counterparts (Saarikkomäki, Lehti, and Kivivuori 2019) ."

    "text": "5.3 Youth crime surveys\nFindings in adult populations cannot necessarily be generalised to youths. The most recent international criminological youth survey is the third sweep of the International Self-Report Delinquency Study (ISRD-3), targeting 13–16-year-olds. Its report shows last year crime prevalence rates for 22 European countries, with measurements in selected big cities between 2012 and 2015 (Enzmann et al. 2018) . In that study, Finland’s ranking varied according to different types of victimisation. In robbery victimisation, Finland had the highest prevalence in Europe, while in assault victimisation, only 18 % of the comparison countries had lower victimisation prevalence than Finland. Thus, it appears that violent behaviour against youths in Finnish cities was expressed as robberies in 2012-2013. The offenders were typically slightly older youths, with over-representation by persons identified by the victims as being of non-Finnish origin (Kivivuori et al. 2014) .\nThe Health Behaviour in School Aged Children survey (HBSC), operated by the World Health Organization, corroborates the low Finnish assault/violence victimisation prevalence. In 2018, among 15-year-olds, only 12 per cent of the 43 comparison countries manifested a lower prevalence rate of fighting than Finland (Inchley et al. 2020).\nIn ISRD3, Finland also ranked relatively high in theft victimisation, as 86 per cent of the comparison countries had lower last year prevalence. The same applied to hate crime victimisation (73 % of comparison countries with lower rates). Thus, with the exception of assault/violence, the Finnish youth victimisation rates have been above average in European comparison, as revealed by international self-report surveys. Overall, comparative surveys among adults converge to suggest that violence and threats are more prevalent in Finland than could be predicted solely from living standards and the welfare state regime. At least in the 1990s, theft prevalence was below most comparison countries. It is unfortunate that the International Crime Victim Surveys were discontinued after 2005.\nIn contrast, Finnish youths do not emerge as suffering from heightened violence risk, with the possible exception of robbery. Relatively high violence victimisation rates among adults, as suggested by international crime surveys, could also reflect methodological factors, such as more honest responding in victim surveys, or cultural factors, such as wider violence concepts applied by the respondents (Kivivuori et al. 2014) . However, homicide rate comparisons are consistent with survey-based findings on violence, thus validating one another. It appears to be possible to tentatively suggest that in European comparison, Finland’s violence problem may also extend to non-lethal and ‘everyday’ violence among adults, but not among youths.\n\n\n\n\nAromaa, Kauko, and Markku Heiskanen. 2006. “Kansainvälinen rikosuhritutkimus vaikeuksissa.” Haaste 3 (6): 1617.\n\n\nDijk, Jan van, Kesteren, John, and Paul Smit. 2007. “Criminal Victimisation in international Perspective.” In.

    "text": "Crime trends in Finland\nYou can find the PDF version from the original publication Rikollisuustilanne 2022 Crime trends in Finland\n\nIn Finland, homicide decreased from the early 1990s until recently; the drop may have levelled out or reversed in 2020–22.\nFinnish homicide remains dominated by marginalised male alcoholics and drinking group conflicts.\nAssault offences remained stable in 2013–2022, a trend corroborated by victim surveys. Rape offences increased during the decade, also corroborated by victim surveys.\nThe numbers of child sexual abuse offences reported to the police have varied annually but increased in recent years in both crimes reported to the police and victim surveys.\nPersonal and household theft victimisation decreased, while theft offences reported to the police remained stable. The divergence can reflect theft against businesses being more stable than personal victimization.\nFraud and identity theft have increased, a trend corroborated by both administrative statistics and the national crime victim survey.\nThe role of alcohol in violent offending decreased, even though the influence of alcohol remains prevalent in violence.\nIn the 15–17 age group, violence, theft and property destruction decreased in the early part of the decade, levelling out after that. In the 18–20 age group the trends of violence, theft and property destruction were similar to the 15–17-year-olds.\nIn Finland, youths under 15 years of age are not criminally culpable. However, their offences are recorded in administrative crime statistics. In this age category, the recorded assault offence rate doubled from 2013 to 2022. While reporting propensity may have increased, available research suggests that the trend may also capture real increase of aggression. Patterns such as use of sharp instruments and offenders taking videos of the crime have increased.\nInternational comparisons of violence in European and Nordic adult populations suggest that Finland has above-average problems related to both lethal and other violence. According to EU-wide comparisons, Finland has a high rate of both partner and non-partner violence against women.\n\nUnless otherwise mentioned, the trends in this report refer to the decade 2012–2022. This report emphasises findings on homicide, and findings cross-validated by administrative statistics and KRIMO crime surveys.\n\n\nFinland\nSituated in northern Europe, Finland has a population of 5.5 million (2022). In terms of socio-political institutions, Finland belongs to a group of Nordic welfare states with Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. It has a compulsory and free-of-charge school system, connecting all youths to educational institutions up to the age of 18. With 49,000 US dollars as average annual income, the country ranks 16th among 38 OECD countries (OECD Data). Regarding the criminal justice system, Finland represents a culture of penal moderation, with policy emphasis on prevention and rehabilitation. The Finnish prisoner rate of 43 per 100,000 population rate is one of the lowest in Europe (Aebi et al. 2021) and the world.\n\n\n\n\nAebi, Marcelo, Edoardo Cocco, Lorena Molnar, and Mélanie M.
